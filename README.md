KrISS_Skap
==========
A simple and smart (or stupid) escape game generator.

An example is available on [tontof.net](http://tontof.net/skap).

Installation
============
* If you just want to use KrISS Skap, download [index.html](https://raw.github.com/tontof/kriss_skap/master/index.html) file and modify escape variable depending your scenario.

* If you want to look at the source, look at the src directory.
To generate index.html file, just run the command :
bash generateIndex > index.html

Features
========
* Generate a page with different content (title, text, modal, form, question, multiform, page)

* You can navigate between pages answering forms (depending on correct or wrong answer)

TODO
====
* Obfuscate the answer so it's not readable on source code
